## Note for This Class
1. This is one of the most diffcult class I took when I was an undergraduate. But the content of class is very important. I was asked a lot about operating systems in interviews. 
2. Some parts of this class can be very difficult to understand, so it can be helpful to look some lectures online or watch the recorded videoes of the class several times.
3. The assignments for this class are usually the same (or only a small change), and I was told that our professors wrote the same assignments as we did when they took this class, so you may be able to find a lot of answers online, But please use these answers as reference and understand before writing.
4. PA3 is the hardest assignment in this class, for PA3 my code has some bugs, so please take that into consideration when referencing my assignment
