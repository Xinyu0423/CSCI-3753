Each time user run the code, the user needs to remake it by typing
make clean
it will clear all the previous document.

To compile again, type
make
it will compile all the code.

To test predict-lru, type
./test-lru 
This will run the predict-lru implementation.

To test predict.c, type
./test-predict 
This will run the predict implementation.

Logic Description:
For the predicting, it first create a struct page struct that contain
page number and its frequency. Then intialize all the page number to -1
and frequency to 0. Then pageout all the previous pages to create spaces
and calculate the frequency of all pages. Use the lru implementation
to check if the page is not in memory. Then, to make the prediction 
check the frequency and pagin all the pages that frequency is greater or equal to 1.
